Basic dynamics and quadrotor model: pages 2-3
  - Note the definition of the rotation matrix. The math looks really complex at first. Think of it as a black box 
    that makes handling reference frames.
Body forces and torques: equation 8
Attitude, position, velocity estimation: pages 6-9
  * Lots of math
Attitude and trajectory control: pages 10-11
  * Will add more on this later
